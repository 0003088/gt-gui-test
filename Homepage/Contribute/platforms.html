              <li>Elektra needs platform specific storage backends to be written. For Linux, BSD and Unix, the current backend is fine. For Windows, a Registry storage backend is needed.</li>
              <li>Elektra needs to be ported, mainteined and packaged in other platforms. Windows, BSD, Mac, other Unix.</li>
              <li>Elektra binary packages and their maintainers are need for Slackware, Debian, SuSE Linux, Mandrake, etc. I provide Fedora/Red Hat RPMs.</li>
