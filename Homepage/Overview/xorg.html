          <p>All higher level software keys are located under <tt class="filename">system/sw</tt>, as showed above for XFree86 configuration. Pay attention to how easy it is to access and change XFree configuration, without any <tt class="filename">/etc/X11/XF86Config</tt> parsing effort, when using Elektra. XFree will look for its keys under <tt class="filename">system/sw/XFree/current</tt> which is a symbolic link to <tt class="filename">system/sw/XFree/handmade</tt>. This is an example on how the high level usage of symbolic links into the key database provides a lot of flexibility.</p>
