        <p>The Elektra Project provides an alternative back-end for text configuration files.</p>
        <p>Instead of each program to have its own text configuration files, with a variety of formats, Elektra tries to provide a universal, hierarchical, fast and consistent namespace and infrastructure to access configuration parameters through a key-value pair mechanism. This way any software can read/save its configuration/state using a consistent API.</p>
        <p>Being a common infrastructure, it also lets other softwares be aware of this application configurations, leveraging easy software integration.</p>
        <p>It is designed to be lightweight, with no dependencies, ready to be used also by early boot stage programs.</p>
        <p>Using Elektra, configuration file's syntax and handling will not be a rework for each software.</p>
        <p>Elektra lets system administrators control security in a much fine grained way. With the current flat file paradigm it is impossible to control permissions and access times on each <tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt> or <tt class="filename">/etc/shadow</tt> atoms. Elektra lets you do that because each information atom stored in it (key) has a unique name (key name) and access properties.
