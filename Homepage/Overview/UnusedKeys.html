        <p>Old/uninstalled software may leave unused keys into the Elektra database. Actually, this can also happen with regular text configuration files. Garbage collection of keys and files is done by the package manager or the sysadmin. The Elektra API and the <span><b class="command">kdb</b></span> command line tool provide ways to find keys that were not accessed for a long time.</p>
        <p>When a user is removed from the system, his keys disapear when his <tt class="envar">$HOME</tt> dir is removed.</p>
