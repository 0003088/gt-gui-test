        <p>The benefits of Elektra will be felt only when configurations like those under <tt class="filename">/etc</tt> will move into it. It is expected that this will take time, but awareness should be raised in the community to speed the process.</p>
        <p>Experienced Unix sysadmins seem (and were expected to be) sceptical about a key-value database on Linux, even when the Elektra Initiative tries to address other OSes registry's problems (centralization, security, consistency). But it is a truly required OS component from a good architecture perspective, and it can solve most of the Linux software integration issues, when adopted.</p>
        <p>Elektra is expected to be adopted by developers of high-level software applications. Then by some Linux distribution specific admin tools, like redhat-config-network, then finally by main OS programs and libraries, like <span><b class="command">/sbin/init</b></span>, PAM, <span><b class="command">/bin/mount</b></span>, etc.</p>
