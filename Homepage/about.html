<h1>The Elektra Project</h1>
This is the new Webpage. The old one with the same
content but one long page is

<h2>About</h2>
Elektra provides a universal and secure framework to store
configuration parameters in a hierarchical key-value pair
mechanism, instead of each program using its own text
configuration files. This allows any program to read and save
its configuration with a consistent API, and allows them to be
aware of other applications' configurations, permitting easy
application integration. While architecturally similar to other
OS registries, Elektra does not have most of the problems found
in those implementations.

<h2>Bindings</h2>
Elektra is available for many different languages. Thus the core
only depends on libc, its easy to develop new bindings.

<h2>Backends</h2>
<p>A great feature of elektra is that you can implement your own
Backend with a set of functions. So it is possible to have
the database in the way you want.</p>
<p>Filesys is ready for use, Ini-Style and Berkleydb are nearly
finished and some other are planned.</p>
