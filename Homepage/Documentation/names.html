<h1>Names</h1>

<p>There are quite many confusing names in elektra, this page
tries to explain them.</p>

<p><strong>elektra</strong> This is the name of the whole
Project. But it appears many times, also in some parts and
in library names</p>

<p><strong>kdb</strong> It means KeyDataBase and is a
commandline tool accessing the database. The header files
for elektra are named that kind too. Functions named
kdb* are used to access the KeyDataBase. All together
you can say: Everything needed for a Programmer and
Administrator to access the keydatabase has <strong>
kdb</strong> in its name</p>

<h1>Librarys</h1>

<p><strong>libelektra.so</strong> This Library is used
to link against applications using the elektra System.
<strong>libelektra.so</strong> does not access the
database alone. To do so, it needs 
<strong>libkdb-BACKEND.so</strong> librarys. It uses
<strong>libkdb-default.so</strong>, the other ones are
just there to be linked to it when needed.</p>

<p><strong>key* and ks*</strong> are a set of functions
which operate on the structs<strong>key and keySet
</strong>.</p>
