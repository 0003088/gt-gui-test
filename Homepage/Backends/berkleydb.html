<h1>Berkleydb</h1>
<p>Developer: Avi Alkalay</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>This backend lacks some features.</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>The whole System-Database is stored into a
single file. Every User has also its own Database
in his Homedirectory.</p>
<p>Thus the right
management in the filesystem is managed
by berkleydb, it will be on
a minimum level of security. It is not possible
that a user can change any system-values if
you want a minimum of security.</p>
<p>With berkleydb you get the fastest and
smallest system possible. It uses the highly
optimized database routines from berkleydb.</p>
<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>This Backend can be used on single user
machines or where users don't have to change
any system variables and one administrator(root)
is fully responsible. It is also perfectly
suited for embedded systems, systems without
network, or systems where no users are logged in.</p>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<p>It is not possible to edit the database
by hand. Use kdb for it.</p>
