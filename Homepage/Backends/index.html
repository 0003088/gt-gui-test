<h1>Backends</h1>
<p>A very important part of libelektra are the kdb* functions.
They are provided through backends. They take care that the
key and keysets are read and written to the database.</p>

<p>There could be an implementation for every surporse. Berkleydb
or fast in-ram hashes for embedded up to sql server requests
for thousends of clients. Its up to you: The backends will
immadiately work with elektrified software.</p>
