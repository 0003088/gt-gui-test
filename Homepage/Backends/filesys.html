<h2>About</h2>
<p>Discussion about filesys on
<a href="http://www.wiki.libelektra.org/index.php/Filesys">
the Wiki</a>.
<p>Filesys stores every key in its own
file. Folders are real folders inside
the filesystem.</p>
<p>Thus the right
management in the filesystem is managed
by the operating system, it will be on
a maximum level of security. Every key
can be equipped with its own set of
permissions or even acls.</p>
<p>Its biggest advantage is its biggest
disadvantage. Because everything is
handled over the operating system many
files needed to be open (2) and close (2).
This will cause a bad performance.
Another Problem might be that every Key
needs, depenend of the filesystem, a
block (e.g. 4 kByte).</p>
<p>The disadvantages might be solved in
future through highly optimized filesystems
which fit they need. Reiserfs is a kandidate
available now.</p>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<p>It is not recommended to edit the Database
per hand. A key looks like that:</p>
<pre>
RG002
40
Test
&lt;DATA&gt;
SERS
</pre>
<p>Does the RG002 and 40 have to be right, these
parts should not be changed. (They set the type
of this file, hopefully this can be removed in
future)</p>
<p>Test is the comment. It can be easily changed.</p>
<p>After the Part &lt;DATA&gt; the Value of the key can be written.
In this case it is SERS</p>
