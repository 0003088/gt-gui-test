<h1>ini</h1>
<p>Developer: Markus Raab</p>
<p>This is a ini-style backend.
  Key/Value Pairs are stored in files in following scheme:
  key1=value1;comment</p>
<p>The design goal is to have a situation as today, but
unified. There should be per application one configuration
file in $HOME and in /etc.</p>
<p>From security standpoint it is between filesys (most
secure possible) and single configuration file (like
berkleydb).</p>
<p>Ini makes it possible that users can edit their
own config files.</p>
