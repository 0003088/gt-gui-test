<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p>Here are frequently asked questions, mainly
on mailing list and irc</p>

<h2>How can I contact you?</h2>
<a href="/About">See here</a>.

<h2>I there a tutorial</h2>
Yes, there is a tutorial for new programmers,
check it out on our <a
href="http://www.wiki.libelektra.org/index.php/Tutorial">Wiki.</a>

<h2>Status of elektra?</h2>
The library is usable now for people which are
willing to follow the development of elektra.
You fill find rarely bugs here and there.
It is not recommended for stable use until we release
the version 1.0.

<h2>Is there a long term roadmap?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before end of year 2006:</strong>
Cleanup API, Improve Testframework, finish
Berkley and Ini Backends</li>
<li><strong>Before end of year 2007:</strong>
Release 1.0 for at least 5 platforms
(Linux, BSD, Windows, 2 other Unixes)
Very well tested on each of them, ready
for public use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are backends?</h2>
Backends mean that the library can write different
configurations formats. The configuration can have
on one system ini style format and on another
XFree86 for all apps.

<h2>I am an Enduser, what is this all about?</h2>
All configurations of apps using elektra can be browsed
graphical like in kde and gnome now, but independ of the
desktop environment.

<h2>I am an Admin, what is this all about?</h2>
You can browse the configuration with a command-line tool
kdb or simple edit it by hand. It even will be possible
to edit it over http like webmin or with a graphical user
interface.

<h2>What language does libelektra uses?</h2>
libelektra uses C, also for the backends. But apps using
elektra can be written in any of the <a href="/Bindings">language
bindings</a>supported languages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>I mean natural languages!</h2>
It is not planned that the homepage, documentation or source
code has any other language then english. But the documentation
of the keys, the guis and apps will certainly support i18n.
The enduser will have anything in their language. People
developing elektra simple have to learn english.

<h2>I want this or that feature</h2>
<p>Simple implement it and send us a patch. If it is good
work we will integrate it 100%. But don't annoy us with
dreams or whatever. We are working on a stable, well tested API
and backends now and not on new features.</p>
<p>Once we have reached 1.0 we are willing to implement
more new stuff in a new devel branch created then. <strong>
Then</strong>we can talk about ACL support and a new
notification API.</p>
