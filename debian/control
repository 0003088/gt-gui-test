Description: development files for a framework to get and set configuration
 Elektra provides a universal and secure framework to store
 configuration parameters in a global, hierarchical key database. The
 core is a small library implemented in C. The plugin-based framework
 fulfills many configuration-related tasks to avoid any unnecessary code
 duplication across applications while it still allows the core to stay
 without any external dependency. Elektra abstracts from
 cross-platform-related issues with an consistent API, and allows
 applications to be aware of other applications' configurations,
 leveraging easy application integration.
 .
 This package contains the files needed to compile and link
 programs which use Elektra.
 It also contains the static library.
