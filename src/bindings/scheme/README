General
=======

This are experimental Scheme bindings for Elektra. They use the FFI[0]
of PLT Scheme, but have been tested only on the Scheme 48
implementation of that FFI, which is included in `s42', a set of
extensions and libraries for Scheme 48.

How to build
============

You need to build s42, as detailed in its README[1]. s42 needs Scheme
48 1.3, other versions won't work yet. In short, after Scheme 48 1.3
is installed:

  darcs get --set-scripts-executable http://download.gna.org/spells/darcs/s42/
  cd s42
  ./scripts/fetch
  ./build.sh
  # "Install" into /usr/local/bin or any other directory in the $PATH
  sudo ln -s `pwd`/build/scheme42 /usr/local/bin/ 

After building and "installing" s42, you need to configure the
download of software bundles in ~/.scheme42.scm:

  mkdir ~/.s42-world
  cat ~/.scheme42.scm
(world-append "/home/rotty/.s42-world" '(gna "http://download.gna.org/spells/bundles"))
  cd ELEKTRA/src/bindings/scheme
  make

Running
========

You can run the testsuite with this command:

scheme42 --load-system elektra,spells \
	 --open elektra,elektra-tools,srfi-1,spells.assert \
	 --script tests.scm
