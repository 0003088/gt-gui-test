This plugin works on Debian Lenny (because of hard coded build system)
with Kde 3.x (because of the way the kde application is initialized)
only. Adaptions are welcome!

It provides an access to kwallet, a convenient and secure way to manage
all your passwords for kde. On any attempts to access the storage you
are prompted for a password with a kde dialog.

It automatically access the local wallet, others are ignored and cannot
be accessed. You can change the local wallet in the preferences.

This plugin uses the kde API. The file behind it typically lies in
~/.kde/share/apps/kwallet/ and the file is named like the Pocket with
the ending .kwl. So you can use this file with a normal resolver or use
the success resolver instead.

For more information about kwallet, see:

* Warning *

This plugin has some severe restrictions and should only be used with
care.
