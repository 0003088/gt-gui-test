== Introduction ==

This is a plugin reading and writing json
based on the library yajl:

http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/


== Mountpoint ==

To mount the plugin you can do:
 kdb mount OpenICC_device_config_DB.json /org yajl

(/org means to mount it both to user/org and system/org)

Then you can copy the OpenICC_device_config_DB.json
to /etc/kdb (or the path you have configured during compile time in
		elektra)

 cp src/plugins/yajl/examples/OpenICC_device_config_DB.json /etc/kdb

 kdb ls system/org

should print out then all device entries available in the config

 kdb get system/org/freedesktop/openicc/device/camera/0/EXIF_manufacturer

should print out "Glasshuette"

This will however hide the key "system", because the root key
of that plugin is "system".
To change the rootkey you have to:
 kdb set system/elektra/mountpoints/_org/config/user_path user/org
 kdb set system/elektra/mountpoints/_org/config/system_path system/org
TODO: bug does not work as it should

Once you have mounted the config, you can export it with:
 kdb export system/org simpleini

== Convert/Import ==

You can also use the (read-only) operations convert/import.
So to output the keyset of the non-mounted file
OpenICC_device_config_DB.json:
 kdb convert yajl simpleini OpenICC_device_config_DB.json

Or to import into the key database:
 cat OpenICC_device_config_DB.json | kdb import system/org yajl

Then you have of course full read/write access to the data.

== Write Support ==

TODO: Currently there is no working write support for the
OpenICC_device_config_DB.json files.
