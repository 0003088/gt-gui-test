## Introduction ##

This plugin is a filter plugin that converts between different character encodings.

## Purpose ##

Consider a user insisting on a `latin1` character encoding because
of some old application. All other users already use, for example,
`UTF-8`. For these users, the configuration files are encoded in
`UTF-8`. So we need a solution for the user with `latin1` to access the
key database with proper encoding.

On the other hand, contemplate an XML file which requires a specific
encoding. But the other key databases work well with the users
encoding. So a quick fix for that backend is needed to feed that XML
file with a different encoding.

Iconv plugin provides a solution for both scenarios. It converts between
many available character encodings. With the pluginâ€™s configuration
the user can change the from and to encoding.  The default values of the
plugin configuration are: `from` encoding will be determined at run time.
`to` encoding is `UTF-8`.

Note that for writing the configuration `from` and `to` is swapped. A
key database that requires a specific encoding can make use of it. To
sum up, every user can select a different encoding, but the key databases
are still properly encoded for anyone.
