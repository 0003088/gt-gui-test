Warning!
This library is part of the stable libelektra 0.7.0 suite.
Incompatible work on it is not prohibited, you are encouraged
to do so.

Note that in the static case, that is when the macro ELEKTRA_STATIC
is set you need to rename all symbols to libelektratools_LTX_symbols.
This must only take place in the source files, not in the header,
otherwise the users symbols will be renamed too, leading to name
clashes.

In addition to that you must add all symbols in the exportsymbols.sh
script, located at src/libelektra.

When you do that, the same code of the user can compile easily to a
static and dynamic variant. The static variant just "renames" the
symbols, while the dynamic really loads the library and lookup the
symbols.
