These document describes the API Changes from 0.7 to 0.8

It was taken care that there are as little as possible,
but two obvious API bugs had to be fixed:
 - the ksNeedsSort() API which is a disaster
 - the metadata which is filesys only (moved to extensions)
 - keyset now describes the desired state of configuration (no removed keys)

keyNext:
	wrong documentation (subsequent calls will still return NULL ptr)

keyMeta:
	newly introduced API
