These document describes the API Changes from 0.7 to 0.8

It was taken care that there are as little as possible,
but three API bugs had to be fixed:

 - the ksNeedsSort() API is no longer needed
   (keyset is always sorted)

   ksSort() removed
   ksNeedSort() removed

 - the metadata which was filesys only is removed

   keyMeta: newly introduced API
   remove old keyGetATime, keyGetUID, ..
   (They are still implemented with new metadata interface in the
    testcases: tests/test_meta.c)

 - keyset now describes the desired state of configuration (no removed keys)

   keyNext: wrong documentation (subsequent calls will still return NULL ptr)


C++ Interface (currently not ABI/API compatible anyway):

- always compare names (not identity) operator== affected
