Add items here which should be implemented within the next release.
Release often, so keep this list very short.
During implementation phase no new items may be added here (only
those which are necessary to fulfil the initial tasks)
Items are e.g. BUGS, OPTIMIZE, PROBLEMS, TESTING, PLUGINS, TODO,..
