Add items here which should be implemented within the next release.
Release often, so keep this list very short.
During implementation phase no new items may be added here (only
those which are necessary to fulfil the initial tasks)
Items are e.g. BUGS, OPTIMIZE, PROBLEMS, TESTING, PLUGINS, TODO,..

== 0.8.4 ==

Improve resolver (create tmp, open original)


== 0.8.5 ==

doxygen 0.8.* upgrade on server->wheezy upgrade

chroot
	-c option which allows you to chroot before doing
	-u options which allows you to switch user (by setting env internally)
	kdbOpen/kdbGet/kdbSet

script testing:
	make scripts safe by chroot (only modify files below /tmp)
	should be executed by make test
	should be able to run tests for all plugins +
	different combination of plugins
	should support partly installations and/or builds (not all plugins)

	line number (maybe not important)
	should be available at target (be installed) why?
	modularity (testing where the code is) (maybe not important)
		-> plugin specifica might be tested at other level/only C
		-> how to do without need of capabilities again? backends at serialization level?? (like with mount)

import/export:
	with all plugins
	with automated kdb tests

kdb testcases:
	get features: cascading(untested)
	default value with sget (untested?)
	for mount/umount
	for import/export/convert

ABI unit tests: (manually)
	install old unit tests with new elektra for ABI tests

debian:
	enable (fix) tests
	add examples as package
	enable all plugins (struct, type, validation!!!)


ship a ./configure script which calls cmake
	+ toplevel Makefile which goes to build directory and calls make there
	./configure && make && make install should work
