== BINDINGS ==

to make elektra available for as many languages as possible, it should
use:

SWIG http://swig.org/ (from C and C++)
gObjectIntrospection https://wiki.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection

or (less general but with specific advantages):
http://docs.cython.org/src/quickstart/overview.html
JNI JNA


== FOCUS ==

use Elektra as much as possible: e.g. zsh, env, ..
*patch* other configuration frameworks to use elektra as storage
fix as many bugs as possible
increase performance

== USE ==

Write cppcms webserver
	which uses ELektra
	delievers its own plugins
	uses the type system
