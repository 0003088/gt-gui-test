umount missing! (rm -r..)

list existing plugins?
	which are available? (src/plugins)
	which are installed
	kdb pls?

= Missing Testcases =

more testcases for kdb interface
	also mount! and check for functionality regressions
	ls over multiple mountpoints


hosts typesafe with plugins enabled

iterator interface (+document better)
ksNext should be safe to missusage?

ksCut

ksCut mit Cursor im Feld geschnitten
Cursor bei ksAppend
Was wenn kein mountpoint angegeben?

backends below other: ls does not work recursively
also ls above multiple plugins

and execute the kdb test functions
(but reduce #)

resolver tests?
