= Missing kdb Features =

list existing plugins?
	which are available? (src/plugins)
	which are installed
	kdb pls?
	(workaround: use ls /usr/lib/elektra)




= Missing Testcases =

test cases for locking file

more testcases for kdb interface
	also mount! and check for functionality regressions
	ls over multiple mountpoints

hosts typesafe with plugins enabled

iterator interface (+document better)

ksNext should be safe to missusage?

cursor placement:
	ksCut within cutted area
	ksAppend

backends below other: ls does not work recursively
also ls above multiple plugins

and execute the kdb test functions
(but reduce #)

resolver tests?
