Here are items that should be implemented within the next releases.
We release often, so this list is short.
During implementation phase no new items may be added here (only
those which are necessary to fulfil the initial tasks).
A complete list of ideas what could be done can be found in the
[todo folder](.).

Also see [githubs issues](http://git.libelektra.org/issues)
for other activities of the current release.
