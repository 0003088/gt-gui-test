Known bugs for current releases will be listed here.
Remove them if they are fixed (git will track them for you).
Move to CURRENT if they should be fixed in next release.


== BASIC ==

keySet/AddBaseName do not handle . or ..

keySet* also work when keys are appended to keyset!
(add a flag for that situation?)



== BUILD ==

ELEKTRA_SET_ERROR in dump sometimes raises compile error

get rid of auto-ptr

clang support broken

VC++ support broken
	try to build with C98 (with one line comments)

portability:
	cross compilation
	bsd, aix,...
	glibc functions away

portability:
	Build on different platforms
	Statical build testing
	build and test without iconv, libxml2

compilers: (add on build-server)
	diet-gcc
	intel cc

one option with NOLOG, DEBUG, VERBOSE  better then
	DEBUG_BUILD and ELEKTRA_VERBOSE_BUILD

=== BUGS ===

warning in resolver aborts execution? (uname plugin)

kdb set system/elektra/version/constants/KDB_VERSION_MINOR
fails silently

errorKey not propagated in elektraPluginOpen
	errors should be transformed to warnings

validation-set of kdb sets other meta keys then which are checked

on non-writeable config files the problem would
	only occur when committing -> behaviour?

kdbGet: what if returned holds more information then requested
	by parentKey on an update

network filesystem in fstab plugin?

Check if merging configuration after conflict fails
	(kdbGet() after conflict with an empty keyset?)

kdbOpen does not work without errorKey
Name of errorKey is overwritten!

KeySet may be unsorted in some situations
	changing key names
	changing owner?

keyowner:
	add or drop support for owner of keys?
	TODO in resolver

if needed conf lacks a root key it is handled wrongly

generating unique names for fstab does not work
	none fs entries
	kdb-fstab-set does not work on dump or similar

hosts:
	alias in large file fails

allow to set a keyset when get failed before?

hard coded limit of characters in simpleset

keyGetStringSize missing
	needed?

path: UUID= LABEL= rechner:/...
	/proc/filesystems
	5th and 6th field is optional


== potential bugs ==

errorKey not propagated in elektraPluginOpen

validation-set of kdb sets other meta keys then which are checked

backends below other: ls does not work recursively
could not parse file output in tcl!

	only occur when committing -> behaviour?

kdbGet: what if returned holds more information then requested
	by parentKey on an update

network filesystem in fstab plugin?

implement a contract and plugin version

Check if merging configuration after conflict fails
	(kdbGet() after conflict with an empty keyset?)

kdbOpen does not work without errorKey
Name of errorKey is overwritten!

non-recursive versions of cp, rm and mv segfault
	(lookup KDB_O_POP in C++?)

system and user are not valid keys?
	kdb ls user ??
