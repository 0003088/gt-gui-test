Lacking documentation for current releases.

currently following resources are available:
	freedesktop (synced with README)
	thesis (running out of date!)
	API (many parts missing, not linked with thesis)

Thesis should be:
	brought up to date
	build as official part
	integrated with rest of documentation

Alternative:
	Make homepage with all information
	Using doxygen?

This document describes what is missing in the documentation


== ISSUES ==

documentation of the c++ binding, plugins

document return value of resolver + other plugins

rewind not clearly defined:
	rewind before plugins?
	rewind after plugins?
	rewind after get()?
	rewind after set()?
	-> write pre+postconditions

not clearly defined how config file is opened
	(temporary file needs to be opened write+create)


documentation:
	comment -> meta data
	split real meta data functions + kdbhelpers

== MISSING ==

api:
	add examples
	add tutorial

c docu:
	mark internal docu + hide it
	add examples in docu, make more examples

plugin writers guide:
	needs to be rewritten (doc.c only as base)

== OTHER TASKS ==

jenkins:
	job for docu
	use docu from build server?


== DOCUMENTATION ==

write tutorials:
	api introduction
	examples
	how to use kdb tools
	how to mount

bsd licence:
	check for documentation, homepage, modules,...

all exported methods of elektra need to be:
	useful in current state
	well documented in behavior
	having test cases for behavior
	behavior not overlapping with another function
	well documented error cases, return and errno values
	having test cases for error cases
	otherwise fix or mark it obsolete

symbols:
	check exported symbols
	use symbol table

add projects using elektra


== OVERVIEW ==

draw a big picture

make list of all symbols
	exported symbols
	reduce it hard
	symbole, only export (sonst static)
	Version info 4.0

dissertation with full API docu and tutorials
+ with homepage in mind
architecture for elektra eco system
