== ABI compatability tests ==

need defined set of tests which only use tests.h (and not internal,..)
deploy them correctly and run old tests with new elektra

== cpptests ==

make common cmake test infrastructure for cpp plugin tests
needed in: type, dump (currently no tests)

== srcdir ==

Currently a srcdir is defined, but no dir to write to
needed for fstab, dump and so on tests..

== testmod ==

most plugins do not use PLUGIN_OPEN interface
most plugins (especially storage) do only basic or no tests
	dump
	fstab
	hosts


= Missing Testcases =

test cases for locking file

more testcases for kdb interface
	also mount! and check for functionality regressions
	ls over multiple mountpoints

hosts typesafe with plugins enabled

iterator interface (+document better)

ksNext should be safe to missusage?

cursor placement:
	ksCut within cutted area
	ksAppend

backends below other: ls does not work recursively
also ls above multiple plugins

and execute the kdb test functions
(but reduce #)

resolver tests?

Partly written configuration tests?
	(rollback at commit?)
converting of config files (automated tests)

== ADVANCED ==

testing coverage:
	-fprofile-arcs
	-ftest-coverage
	reasoning which parts are tested

advanced testing:
	get and set a real big amount of keys
	multithreading testing


testing framework step by step
	with all metadata
	with all calling combinations
	(test driven development)

see if config file does proper roundtrips
