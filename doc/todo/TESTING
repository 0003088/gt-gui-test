== ABI compatability tests ==

need defined set of tests which only use tests.h (and not internal,..)
deploy them correctly and run old tests with new elektra

== cpptests ==

make common cmake test infrastructure for cpp plugin tests
needed in: type, dump (currently no tests)

== srcdir ==

Currently a srcdir is defined, but no dir to write to
needed for fstab, dump and so on tests..

== testmod ==

most plugins do not use PLUGIN_OPEN interface
most plugins (especially storage) do only basic or no tests
	dump
	fstab
	hosts

== scripts ==

script testing:
	should be runned by make test
	should be available at tarket (be installed)
	can be everything directly at the kdb commandline tool
	should be able to run tests for all plugins +
	different combination of plugins
	should support partly installations and/or builds (not all plugins)
	line number (maybe not important)
	modularity (testing where the code is) (maybe not important)
		-> plugin specifica might be tested at other level/only C
		-> how to do without need of capabilities again? backends at serialization level?? (like with mount)

import/export:
	with all plugins
	with automated kdb tests

kdb testcases:
	for mount/umount
	for import/export/convert
	using chroot

ABI unit tests: (manually)
	install old unit tests with new elektra for ABI tests
