== ABI compatability tests ==

need defined set of tests which only use tests.h (and not internal,..)
deploy them correctly and run old tests with new elektra

== srcdir ==

Currently a srcdir is defined, but no dir to write to
needed for fstab, dump and so on tests..

== testmod ==

most plugins do not use PLUGIN_OPEN interface
most plugins (especially storage) do only basic or no tests
	dump
	fstab
	hosts
