Plugins to be added for current releases.
Implement and test easy to implement, but useful plugins
as many different plugins as possible.
Prefer using great frameworks to do that in short time.


== DEFINITION ==

rewind not clearly defined:
	rewind before plugins?
	rewind after plugins?
	rewind after get()?
	rewind after set()?
	-> write pre+postconditions


== OS abstraction ==

getcwd plugin

== DISTRIBUTOR BACKENDS ==

can be used as default using symlinks

1.st level citizen
	allow resolver only (one plugin for backend to be able to hierarchically stack backends)
	share modules globally (to allow loading of module within module)

mount: current implementation
mount-mpi: current implementation, but multithreaded
filesystem: implementation compatible with 0.7
lazy-mount
bind-mount
owner support
user-mount

do not hardcode 10 plugins (rationale?)



== JSON ==

yail
	advanced functionality
	finish kdbSet
	test roundtrips
	configureable root
	compilation variants: yail 1+2

json serialization:
	* should handle cppcms config files
	  http://cppcms.com/wikipp/en/page/cppcms_1x_config
	* should handle openicc
	  doc/standards/OpenICC_device_config_DB.json
	  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/icc_meta_tag_for_monitor_profiles

http://json-schema.org

== PRETTY ==

latex plugin to make pretty printed key/value pairs
dot/graphviz plugin to visualize graph of keys
html plugin (to show elektra config in html format)
csv plugin with metadata as additional columns (configureable)

literate data
	good for documentation
	everything is ignored except special introduced key/value pairs
	<start><key><seperator><value><terminator>
	needs two more special characters next to seperator, but is
	otherwise alike


== CPPPLUGIN ==

cppplugin:
	make a nice and easy cpp solution for plugins
	(integration into cpp binding)
	assemble C symbols with macros
	keep C->C++ problems at one place to be included

C++: (FINISH cppplugin)
	how to write backends in C++
	Exceptions propagations
	(C++ Exceptions to error codes)


== STORAGE ==

xpath plugin:
	on an xml file with an mapping from (reduced) xpath<->elektra keys

C serialization
	(ksNew(keyNew()))

using libraries:
	libconfig
	eet

/etc/groups plugin

filesys:
	reintroduce? (useful for 0.7 migrations)
	empty folder will not show up (only with %%dirdata)
	Dirdata richtig escapen
	Metadata reinschreiben
	remove keys the new way
	compare sets between current and desired state (set operations)
	could be default-storage plugin, integrated resolver for previous siutation

other file formats:
	xfree
	apache
	kde-ini
	gconf
	xml
	inittab

fstab:
	support for spaces and so on (with \040)

error specification plugin:
	parse error specification content into keyset

tcl:
	parse output?
	struct output!

create storage plugins with lenses


== FILTER ==

Forensic Logging:
	environment, pid, gid, uid
	timezone + in ms
	IP

filter: key
	metadata lÃ¶schen
	hidden keys


advanced:
	hash sum
	signing
	encrypting
	binding

base64 encoding (and reverse)

libgcryt (LGPL, GPLv3?) used by cppcms

make name lowercase
	(case sensitivity can be error prone)

infer links between configuration (user/a=@user/b)
	and copy values

convert units (e.g. G, M, m,..) to values (and back)


== TYPE ==

struct: checker
	cannot be deeply nested
	don't throw char*
	string as element of exception class

Checkers:
	check if hosts are reachable (/etc/hosts)



=== RESOLVER ===

make (at least) 4 resolvers:
	resolver-debug for tests
		concurrency: sets breakpoints within
		folder: write into folders controlled by env, maybe xdg
	resolver-xdg-passwd
		use passwd with XDG overides
	resolver-xdg
		use $HOME with XDG overides
	resolver-hardcoded (just use KDB_DB_* for single users embedded systems)
	resolver-passwd
	resolver-posix
		using HOME def. in posix: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html
		using USER as fallback? not def. in posix, but often in shells

race conditions:
	the losing process must not remove the .tmp file, but it
	has to remove all .tmp files it created before (in those cases
		it won)
	-> needs also some logic within kdbSet() to handle this

use nanoseconds timestamps, maybe avoid locking completely
fsync: both file+directory

remove files on empty keysets (also needs logic in kdbSet())

tmp files:
	thread ID + randomness?

resolver:
	configureable flush+locking

kdb file
	using resolver plugin without function! (parent value!)
	should be returned in kdbGet/kdbSet?

XDG specification:
	write a xdg plugin which does xdg conforming resolving
	XDG_CONFIG_HOME
	describe, implement, test
	xdg mail announce

== DEFAULT PLUGINS ==

default plugin handling: resolver/storage

policy how default storage & resolver plugin are named
resolve the symlink and load the module with correct name

default storage plugin:
	changeable
	nickel with meta in [] sections?

DEFAULT_BACKEND ->
	DEFAULT_STORAGE_PLUGIN
	DEFAULT_RESOLVER_PLUGIN
	(+ make it work)
	good out-of-the-box behaviour


others:
	memory (just hold everything in a keyset)
	bind (just map keys from somewhere else)

	meta-infos hide

	Namecencode
	nameutf8encode
	namehexencode
