# Unit Testing Framework

## Issue

The previous unit testing framework started as hack to have a bit more
than simple asserts. It is not easy to use (needs explicit enumeration
of all testcases) and lacks of really important features (e.g. output of
the assertion that failed).


## Constraints

- Must be BSD licenced
- Must be easy to use


## Assumptions

## Considered Alternatives

- Continue with current framework
- Boost Unit Testing framework


## Decision

- Google Unit testing framework


## Argument

To be copied here, currently see Mailinglist.


## Implications

Needs rewrite of current C++ unit tests.
