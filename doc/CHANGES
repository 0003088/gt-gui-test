These document describes the Changes from Elektra 0.7 to 0.8

== API ==

It was taken care that there are as little as possible,
but three API bugs had to be fixed:

 - the ksNeedsSort() API is no longer needed
   (keyset is always sorted)

   ksSort() removed
   ksNeedSort() removed

 - the metadata which was filesys only is removed

   keyMeta: newly introduced API
   remove old keyGetATime, keyGetUID, ..
   (They are still implemented with new metadata interface in the
    testcases: tests/test_meta.c)

 - keyset now describes the desired state of configuration (no removed keys)

   keyNext: wrong documentation (subsequent calls will still return NULL ptr)


C++ Interface (currently not ABI/API compatible anyway):

- always compare names (not identity) operator== affected


== Build system ==

 - Changed from autotools to cmake.

 - No more dependency to libtool.

 - C++ is now a build dependency.
   Rationale: C++ is used by cmake too.
   Only the "dump" plugin needs to be rewritten in C to remove that dependency.

 - No LD_LIBRARY_PATH or ld.so.conf needed anymore.
   Instead RPATH is used.

 - New build variant: libelektra-full
   It is a dynamic library with everything statically included.

== Languages ==

 -  Core is now Ansi C 99.

 -  C++ is now officially supported by plugins.
    Note that C++ interface is not yet API/ABI compatible.
