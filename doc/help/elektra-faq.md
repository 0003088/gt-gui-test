## I am stuck. Where can I get help?

If this FAQ does not contain your question, [please open an issue](http://git.libelektra.org/issues).
You can simply remove all template text and it is enough if the issue only contains your question.
If you want you can [label it as question](http://git.libelektra.org/issues/labels/question), but we
can also categorize it for you.

Please do not waste too much time to find something out yourself. Information where people get
stuck is valuable to improve Elektra and its documentation. Even if you find out directly after
you posted the question: the pointer can be helpful for other people having the same problem.


## What should I do if I found a bug?

Please check the [issue tracker](http://git.libelektra.org/issues) if it has already been reported.
If it has not, please [fill out the template](http://git.libelektra.org/issues/new).


## How can I contribute to Elektra?

Due to the modular architecture we can accept nearly all contributions as plugins.
Please only make sure that the README.md clearly states the purpose and quality
of the plugin. If you need, e.g., a plugin that crashes the process make sure that
you tag (`infos/status`) it with `discouraged`.

Please start by reading [here](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## What is the Elektra's license?

[New BSD license](/doc/LICENSE.md) which allows us to have plugins link against GPL
and GPL-incompatible libraries. If you compile Elektra, e.g., with GPL plugins, the
result is GPL.


## Who are the authors?

[List of authors](/doc/AUTHORS).
