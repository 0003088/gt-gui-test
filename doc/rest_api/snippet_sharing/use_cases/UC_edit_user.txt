Title: edit user
Scope: User Management

Scenarios:
----------------------------
Precondition: Authenticated, sufficient permissions
Main success scenario: Changes to the user account have been stored to the database successfully. The operating user is informed about the success through a response from the server.
Alternative scenario: The submitted inputs could not be validated or the user entry for which changes are requested cannot be found. The server responds with an error message.
Error scenario: Technical problems prevent the storage process from completing. The operating user is informed about the issue through an error response.
Postcondition: Changes to the user account are stored in the database successfully and are from now on valid for further requests (e.g. authentication attempts).
