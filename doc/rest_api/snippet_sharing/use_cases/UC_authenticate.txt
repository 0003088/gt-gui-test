Scope: Authentication
Level: User Goal
Actors: Anonymous User
Brief: Any not logged in user can authenticate to the service.

Scenarios:
----------------------------
Precondition:
Main success scenario: User successfully authenticates against the server. Server responds with a session token that is used for authentication in further requests.
Alternative scenario: The authentication was not successful (e.g. wrong credentials) and the server responds with an error.
Error scenario: Technical problems prevent the authentication from succeeding (e.g. connection issues). The user is informed through an error response.
Postcondition: Service is in authenticated state, meaning that all subsequent requests will use the authentication token to identify to the server.
Non-functional Constraints: 
	- Security mechanism
	- Is precondition to use other functions
