The purpose of this specification-by-example is to define a standard way for systems to provide their own signature.
It is important because today there is no safe way for somebody (a program) to know exactly on which
OS (platform, version, update level, edition) it is running.

This is particulary useful for installation programs, when they must take decision about where to put files they'll
install, since each OS have slight differences about their filesystem organization, etc.

Its purpose is similar to the files installed by redhat-release or SuSE-release packages, but better:

/etc/issue
/etc/issue.net
/etc/redhat-release

This is a very simple structure, and here follows the signature for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 update 2 (Nanant):

system/signature
  provider     = Red Hat
  os           = Linux
  type         = redhat
  edition      = AS
  version      = 4
  update       = 2
  architecture = ia32
  readable     = Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 AS update 2 (Nanant)
  releasename  = Nanant
  url          = http://www.redhat.com/




A Novell Linux Desktop would have this signature:

system/signature
  provider     = Novell
  os           = Linux
  type         = suse
  edition      = NLD
  version      = 10
  update       = 0
  architecture = ia32
  readable     = Novell Linux Desktop
  url          = http://www.novell.com/



A Fedora 4 system for Opteron processos would be:

system/signature
  provider     = Fedora
  os           = Linux
  type         = redhat
  version      = 4
  architecture = x86_64
  readable     = Fedora Core 4
  url          = http://fedora.redhat.com/
