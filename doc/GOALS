define goals and put them on homepage (+mailinglist)

== Quality Goals ==

1.) Extensibility

There are so many variants of
- storage formats
- frontend integrations
- bindings

Nearly every aspekt of Elektra must be extremely extensible.
On the other side semantics must be very clear and well defined
so that this extensible system works reproduceable and predictable.


2.) Simplicity

An overly complex system cannot be managed nor understood.
On the other side extensibility brings some complex issues,
which need to be solved - but in a way so that the user
sees either nothing of it or only needs to understand very
simple concepts in order that it works flawlessly.
Special care for simplicity is taken for the users:
- Endusers when doing Elektra or Configuration upgrades
  (they should never take any notice of Elektra, except that
   it works better integrated and with less problems)
- Frontend Programmers to integrate Elektra
- Plugin Programmers to extend Elektra
- Application's Maintainers to correctly setup+upgrade KDB
- Administrators which want to change the maintainers setup
  according to their needs


3.) Performance

Configuration is the main impact for bootup and startup time.
Elektra needs to be similar fast then current solutions.
Ideally it should get faster because of centralized optimization
endeavours where everyone using Elektra can benefit from.
