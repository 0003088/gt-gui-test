= INTRODUCTION =

== BASIC GIT COMMANDS ==

git add .
git commit -a

== Branches ==

To list all remote branches use:
 git-branch -a

To checkout a remote branch initially use:
 git-checkout -b <branchname>

To merge a branch use (no-fastforward):
 git-merge --no-ff <branchname>

Following remote branches should exist:

 master

This is the development branch. Please try
to not work directly on it, but instead
you should use feature branches. So the
only commits on master should be non-fastforward
merges from features branches.

 release

Once the master is ready to be released,
it should be merged to the release branch
with --no-ff. So on the release branch
there are only merges from master.

 debian

Merge changes from the release branch to
the debian branch in order to make
debian packages.



= MIGRATION =

This git folder was imported initially with the command:
git svn clone -T trunk -t tags -b unstable https://svn.libelektra.org/svn/elektra

then every remote branch (git branch -a) was checked out using:
git checkout -b $BRANCH $BRANCH

== OTHER TRY ==

(lead to elektra-history)

git svn clone --authors-file=/home/markus/Projekte/Elektra/current/doc/GIT_AUTHORS --prefix=svn/ -T trunk -t tags -b unstable https://svn.libelektra.org/svn/elektra


git svn-abandon-fix-refs
git svn-abandon-cleanup

(nice authors, branches and tags.. but unstable branch missing!)
