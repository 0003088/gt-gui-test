Elektra (and thus all application using it) is effected by the
following environment variables:

USER
The current user will be owner of all freshly allocated keys.

KDB_USER
With that variable you can override USER. Use this if you don't
want to change USER but the owner of new keys.
[API: keySetName()]

HOME
The home-directory will be used to store user-configuration.

KDB_HOME
With that variable you can override HOME. Use this if you don't
want to change HOME but the location of user-configuration.
Example: KDB_HOME as /usr/homes/markus will try to store the user-configuration
to /usr/homes/markus/.kdb/ (regardless of the user).
[API: kdbbGetFullFilename()]

KDB_DIR
Thus with KDB_HOME the user-configuration will land to a directory with the postfix
.kdb added, KDB_DIR provides you direct access to where the user-configuration
should be saved. This variable has precedence to KDB_HOME.
This is the perfect way to just say: I don't want to use my configuration
in /home/markus/.kdb, please use something else instead.

KDB_ROOT (kdb-tool only)
With that variable you can store a common prefix of keys you
want to set and get afterwards to save typing time.
