== PREPARATION ==

Elektra is now using cmake.

To compile it, please create a folder:

 mkdir build

go into the folder

 cd build



== RUN CMAKE ==

tested cmake version: 2.6-patch 0

run ccmake:

 ccmake ..

press c to configure and then e to exit

if you want to create a package afterwards it is ok to use
pathes that you can write to (e.g. CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX /home/markus/bin)

working plugins are:
dump;resolver;hidden;iconv;syslog;error;validation;xmltool;tracer;timeofday;dbus;glob;hosts;network;type;struct;path;fstab;ccode;
simpleini;tcl;hexcode;null;ni

BACKEND_DEFAULT only dump is tested currently

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: Debug or Release (see cmake docu in the net for that option)

DEBUG_BUILD and ELEKTRA_VERBOSE_BUILD: make the library to output some or a lot of things (not recommended options)

KDB_DB_SYSTEM is the path where the system configuration is

WITH_DOC: build documentation with doxygen
kdb does not have docu at the moment


then press c again and then g to generate



== BUILDING ==

with

 make

you build the source (you can pass -j or similar)



== CodeBlocks ==

You can build Elektra using Code::Blocks under Gentoo:

Precondition:
Make sure you have a compiler, xml2 (for kdb tool) and xsl (see later)
installed. cmake configure will help you with that, it will make sure you don't forget something
essential.

For Most Linux system all you have to do is open up a console and 

 mkdir build 
 cd build 
 cmake .. -G 'CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles' 
 make package


Note  1:
	You can use other editor if you like just type cmake at the
	console to get a list of option you can pass to cmake as long as well
	as a list of what code editor project cmake can create.

Note 2:
	For Unix if you have nCurses install you can run ccmake to set important option after
	running cmake like to enable debug symbol.

Note 3: 
	for Gentoo is recommend to emerge sys-apps/lsb-release to name the package 
	right even thou not required.
