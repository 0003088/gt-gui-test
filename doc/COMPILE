== PREPARATION ==

Elektra is now using cmake.

To compile it, please create a folder:

 mkdir build

go into the folder

 cd build

== RUN CMAKE ==

tested cmake version: 2.6-patch 0

run ccmake:

 ccmake ..

press c to configure and then e to exit

if you want to create a package afterwards it is ok to use
pathes that you can write to (e.g. CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX /home/markus/bin)

working plugins are:
dump;resolver;hidden;iconv;syslog;error;validation;xmltool;tracer;timeofday;dbus;glob;hosts;network;type;struct;path;fstab;ccode;
simpleini;tcl;hexcode;null;ni

BACKEND_DEFAULT only dump is tested currently

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: Debug or Release (see cmake docu in the net for that option)

DEBUG_BUILD and ELEKTRA_VERBOSE_BUILD: make the library to output some or a lot of things (not recommended options)

KDB_DB_SYSTEM is the path where the system configuration is

WITH_DOC: build documentation with doxygen
kdb does not have docu at the moment


then press c again and then g to generate


== BUILDING ==

with

 make

you build the source (you can pass -j or similar)

== PACKAGING ==

with

 cpack

you create a package of the platform you are running
(generator needed for it, currently only debian)
