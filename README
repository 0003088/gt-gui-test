Man pages are generated from a DocBook XML using XSLTs from the docbook-style-xsl package (on Fedora), and the xsltproc as the XSLT engine. So rg.1.xml docbook source is converted to the rg.1 man page, for example.

This caused several problems when compiling them in other distros, because of the lack of these tools.

Since version 0.2.7, the compiled man pages are included in the tarball. So unless you 'make clean' globally, you'll be able to 'make; make install' globaly even without these tools.
